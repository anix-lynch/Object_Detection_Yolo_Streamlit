# 🎥 ObjectDetect: Build an Object Detection Web App with YOLOv8 and Streamlit

Welcome to **ObjectDetect**! This project focuses on building a web application that detects objects in videos using the YOLOv8 model. With Streamlit, we’ll create an interactive interface for users to upload videos and detect objects in real-time. Let’s dive into the world of object detection and computer vision! 🖼️🔍

## 🌐 Project Overview

Object detection is a vital component of many AI applications, from autonomous driving to video surveillance. In this project, we’ll use the powerful YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model for detecting and classifying objects in videos. We’ll create a user-friendly web app using Streamlit, allowing users to upload videos and see detected objects in real-time. OpenCV will handle video processing and YOLOv8 will provide accurate object detection.
